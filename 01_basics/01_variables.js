const accountId = 2221
let accountEmail = "vg@xyz.com"
var accountPassword = "fff" 
// var has a scope problem so dont use this use only let and a variable may also be defined without a keyword see below

accountCity = "Jaipur"

accountEmail = "dhfihe@nith.com"

let accountState//if defined only but value not assigned so it takes undefined value just like garbage value in c

console.table([accountId,accountEmail,accountPassword,accountCity,accountState])//this is used to print variables in a tabular format
